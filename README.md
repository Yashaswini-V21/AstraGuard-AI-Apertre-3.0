## 🚀 About the Project

**AstraGuard AI** is an open-source security-focused system that seamlessly combines **AI-assisted threat detection** with **practical offensive security tooling**.

We bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and real-world workflows, making it the perfect platform for students, developers, and early security practitioners to:
- 🛡️ **Test** applications against simulated threats.
- 📊 **Analyze** risks with structured data.
- 🧠 **Understand** vulnerabilities through automated reporting.
- 🎓 **Learn** by bridging theory and real security workflows without unnecessary complexity.

The core engine drives the security operations, while our intelligent AI layer handles attack surface analysis, smart payload generation, and guided exploitation (in safe, controlled environments).

**Target Audience**: Primarily learners and early-stage practitioners who want hands-on experience with modern security workflows.
